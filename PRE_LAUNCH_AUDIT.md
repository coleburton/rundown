# Rundown App - Pre-Launch Audit

## Product Overview
Rundown is a fitness accountability app that connects with Strava to track running goals and sends automated accountability messages to users' contacts (friends, family, coaches) when they miss their weekly running targets.

## Critical Launch-Blocking Gaps

### üö® **Infrastructure & Deployment**
1. ‚úÖ **Production database deployed** - Supabase database with RLS policies, message queue system, and load balancing functions
2. **Backend not deployed** - Go server exists but not live
3. ‚úÖ **Strava integration working** - Webhook endpoints deployed and actively receiving activity data
4. **Message system not live** - Twilio integration planned but not deployed

### üö® **Revenue & Subscription**
1. **RevenueCat not configured** - No API keys, no entitlements setup
2. **No app store presence** - Not ready for distribution
3. **Subscription pricing unclear** - Hard-coded prices don't match strategy
4. **No free trial implementation** - Critical for conversion

## Technical Architecture Gaps

### **Database & Backend**
- ‚úÖ Solid schema design with RLS policies
- ‚úÖ **Production database deployed** with comprehensive RLS, message queue system, and rate limiting
- ‚ùå No environment configuration management
- ‚ùå Missing monitoring/alerting

### **Mobile App**
- ‚úÖ Well-structured React Native with Expo
- ‚úÖ Good component architecture
- ‚ùå Missing proper error handling for API failures
- ‚ùå No offline mode for critical functions

### **Integrations**
- ‚úÖ **Strava webhook callbacks working** - Deployed Edge Functions actively receiving activity data
- ‚úÖ **Message queue processing deployed** with load balancing and rate limiting functions
- ‚ùå RevenueCat entitlements not set up

## Product & UX Gaps

### **Onboarding Flow**
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive screen flow designed
- ‚úÖ **User guidance implemented** - Helpful tooltips added to key screens (goal setup, contact setup)
- ‚úÖ **Robust Strava connection error handling** - Clear error messages, retry functionality, fallback options
- ‚úÖ **Contact phone validation implemented** - International number support (10-15 digits), real-time validation with user feedback

### **Core Features Missing**
1. ‚úÖ **Message preview** - Users can see what contacts receive (implemented in onboarding flow with dynamic message examples)
2. ‚úÖ **Contact management** - Edit/remove functionality available in settings page
3. ‚úÖ **Message history** - Complete message history UI showing sent and scheduled messages
4. ‚úÖ **Goal adjustment** - Full goal update functionality available in settings with confirmation dialogs
5. ‚úÖ **Activity history** - Comprehensive activity tracking with time period filters, stats, and goal progress indicators

### **Monetization Issues**
1. **Unclear value proposition** - Pricing screen doesn't explain ROI
2. ‚úÖ **Analytics tracking implemented** - Comprehensive conversion funnel tracking with Mixpanel
3. **Missing social proof** - No testimonials/success stories
4. **No retention features** - Nothing to keep users engaged

## Go-to-Market Readiness

### **Marketing Assets Missing**
- App store screenshots
- Marketing website/landing page
- Privacy policy & terms of service
- Press kit/media assets

### **Distribution**
- No beta testing program
- Missing app store optimization
- No referral/viral mechanics
- No launch strategy documented

### **Customer Support**
- No help documentation
- No support ticket system
- No user feedback collection
- No FAQ section

## Critical Launch Recommendations

### **Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (2-3 weeks)**
1. ‚úÖ **Deploy Supabase database with proper RLS** - COMPLETED: Full schema with RLS, message queue, and rate limiting
2. Deploy Go backend to Railway/Render
3. ‚úÖ **Configure Strava webhook integration** - COMPLETED: Edge Functions deployed and receiving activity data
4. ‚úÖ **Set up basic message queue processing** - COMPLETED: Load balancing functions deployed

### **Phase 2: Revenue & Distribution (1-2 weeks)**
1. Configure RevenueCat with proper entitlements
2. Implement free trial mechanics
3. Create app store listings
4. ‚úÖ **Add basic analytics tracking** - COMPLETED: Comprehensive Mixpanel integration with conversion funnels

### **Phase 3: Polish & Launch (1 week)**
1. Add error handling and offline support
2. Create privacy policy & terms
3. Set up customer support system
4. Launch beta testing program

## Biggest Risks

1. **Technical debt** - Manual deployment vs automated CI/CD
2. **User retention** - No engagement features beyond shame
3. **Support burden** - Complex integrations = more support tickets
4. **Monetization** - Subscription model without clear value demonstration

## Competitive Advantages to Leverage

1. **Unique social accountability angle** - No direct competitors
2. **Strava integration** - Large, engaged user base
3. **Customizable message styles** - Personalization drives engagement
4. **Simple, focused product** - Easy to understand value prop

## Recommended MVP Scope

**Include:**
- Strava connection
- Basic goal setting
- Contact management
- Automated messages (1 style)
- Simple paywall

**Exclude for v1:**
- Advanced analytics
- Multiple message styles
- Manual activity logging (removed to prevent gaming the system - Strava is source of truth)
- Complex goal types

## Bottom Line

You have a solid foundation with **production database and Strava integration now fully working**. Remaining timeline: **2-3 weeks of focused execution** on message system deployment and revenue configuration. 

**‚úÖ COMPLETED:** 
- Database infrastructure with RLS, message queue system, and load balancing functions
- Strava webhook integration with Edge Functions actively receiving activity data (6 activities tracked)
- Comprehensive analytics tracking with Mixpanel (onboarding funnel, revenue events, core app metrics)
- Polished onboarding UX with guidance tooltips, error handling, and international phone validation
- **Message preview functionality** - Dynamic message examples in onboarding showing what contacts receive
- **Contact management** - Full CRUD functionality in settings (add, view, edit, remove contacts)
- **Message history UI** - Complete message tracking showing sent messages, scheduled messages, and delivery status
- **Goal adjustment** - Users can update goals anytime via settings with confirmation dialogs and proper analytics tracking
- **Activity history** - Advanced activity tracking with time period filters (week/month/quarter/all), comprehensive stats (distance, time, goal progress), and same UI components as dashboard for consistency

**NEXT PRIORITY:** Deploy message sending system (Twilio integration) to complete the core accountability loop.
